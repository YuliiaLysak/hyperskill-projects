Your program should accept two strings: P and R as the first two arguments. P and R represent the pattern to check. Then it should take a folderâ€™s path which contains all of the files to be checked by your program.

Examples:

java Main folder_with_files "-----BEGIN\ CERTIFICATE-----" "PEM certificate"
file.pem: PEM certificate
doc_1.docx: Unknown file type
doc_2.pdf: Unknown file type

java Main test_files "%PDF-" "PDF document"
file.pem: Unknown file type
doc_1.docx: Unknown file type
doc_2.pdf: PDF document
