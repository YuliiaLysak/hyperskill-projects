First, we've checked the naive implementation, and it took roughly 5 seconds. Then KMP showed 5 times better performance. You should expect similar behavior from your program.

Examples:

java Main --naive huge_doc.pdf "%PDF-" "PDF document"
PDF document
It took 5.011 seconds

java Main --KMP huge_doc.pdf "%PDF-" "PDF document"
PDF document
It took 1.037 seconds

java Main --naive pic.png "%PDF-" "PDF document"
Unknown file type
It took 3.641 seconds

java Main --KMP pic.png "%PDF-" "PDF document"
Unknown file type
It took 0.469 seconds
