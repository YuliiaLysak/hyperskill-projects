The patterns.db consist of patterns with their priorities. You can download it here. For example:
4;"PK";"Zip archive"
7;"word/_rels";"MS Office Word 2007+"
7;"ppt/_rels";"MS Office PowerPoint 2007+"
7;"xl/_rels";"MS Office Excel 2007+"

A higher value means higher priority. In this example, the "Zip archive" is a container for multiple files.
However, Microsoft Office files are also stored as Zip archives, you can clearly see this if you rename
file "file.docx" to "file.zip". If you unzip it, you'll see that it contains a bunch of folders and
a bunch of XMLs. So, a Word file contains both "PK" indicating that this is a Zip archive and
"word/_rels" indicating that this is a Word document. In this situation, you should choose a pattern
with higher priority, which is "MS Office Word 2007+".
