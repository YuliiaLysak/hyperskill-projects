## Project: File Server


### About
It's so easy to lose your precious data â€” unless you store it on a server. Besides, file servers allow you to access your files remotely, no matter where you are. In this project, you will create your own file server, even though a simple one.
### Learning outcomes
You will learn how to work with sockets and also improve your multithreading skills.
