Run a shell script

There are three ways to run a shell script:
1) You can open the corresponding directory with your file and type 'bash hello_world.sh'
 This way requires only one command, but do not forget to specify that you want to launch
  the script with Bash.

2) You can make the file executable by typing 'chmod +x hello_world.sh'
 Then you can run it using ./hello_world.sh also from its directory.
  Here, you can skip specifying Bash, but remember to make the file executable.

3) You can replace the file with bin by sudo cp hello_world.sh /usr/local/bin
 and then use only the filename hello_world.sh to run the script.
  As you can see, you may also need sudo (superuser access) to put your file
   in the right place. This way implies that you know how to change a directory
    in Bash and what sudo mode is. And the advantage of this is that the final
     command consists of a filename only.
