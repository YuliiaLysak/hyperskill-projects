## Project: Cinema Room REST Service


### About
Always wanted to have your private movie theater and screen only the movies you like? You can buy a fancy projector and set it up in a garage, but how can you sell tickets? Having a booth is old-fashioned, so let's create a special service for that! Make good use of Spring and write a REST service that can show the available seats, sell and refund tickets, and display the statistics of your venue. Pass me the popcorn, please!
### Learning outcomes
In this project, you will create a simple Spring REST service that will help you manage a small movie theatre. Handle HTTP requests in controllers, create services and respond with JSON objects.
